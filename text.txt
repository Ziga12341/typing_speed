But data published in January showed that despite the higher sticker price, electric cars may actually save drivers money in the long run.
A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology calculated both the carbon dioxide emissions and full lifetime cost — including purchase price, maintenance and fuel — for nearly every new car model on the market.
They found that electric cars were easily more climate friendly than gas-burning ones.
Over a lifetime, they were often cheaper, too.
Electric Cars Are Better for the Planet – and Often Your Budget, Too.
New data published Thursday shows that despite the higher sticker price, electric cars may actually save drivers money in the long-run.
Can the world really keep the temperature rise to under 1.5 degrees Celsius?
Wealthy nations have promised to pursue efforts to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to preindustrial times. But meeting that goal means that all countries must commit to cutting emissions faster and deeper than they are already doing.
For every fraction of a degree of warming, scientists say, the world will experience more intense heat waves and drought, and more deadly floods and wildfires. Humans have already heated the planet by roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, since the 19th century.
Countries have less than 10 years to reduce emissions enough to keep the planet below 1.5 degrees of warming. So if leaders don’t commit to bold steps now, when so much global attention is focused on the Glasgow climate talks, many fear that the world will barrel toward dangerous levels of warming.
Yes, There Has Been Progress on Climate. No, It is Not Nearly Enough.
Nations have started making progress on climate change. But we’re still on track for dangerous warming unless those efforts accelerate drastically.
